# test-data

A repository for the test data I correlate for use in testing software.

Some other great resources for test data:

https://bugmagnet.org/ - a plugin that allows you to insert various different types of test data into web forms

https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings - "an evolving list of strings which have a high probablity of causing issues when used as user-input data"
